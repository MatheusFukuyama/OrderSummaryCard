## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helps me to remind how to use the :hover effect and I also some flex properties. Talking about new knowledge I learned structure a project, read the project design to produce a code and finally to write a readme to the project.

### Continued development

I'm still want to improve my logic and also learn to write clean code, this project still can pass throght changes and refactoring while I get more knowledges.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to remind some of css features.
